# Polynomial-Best-Fitter

Made by d1shs0ap.
Special thanks to Anton and Rorres to writing the linear algebra textbook that I used.
Evaluation of matrices via Gaussian Elimination.
Works for all polynomial degrees.
The project probably has been done countless times before, but I did it again anyways.
